# Crud_Hooks ðŸŽ£

# Motivation
For this project I wanted to deepen my undertanding of state by creating another project using react hooks/UseState.

# Learning
creating this project I learned how to implement the editRow feature, which allow the user to edit their username after its creation. I found this quite useful because in previous project I had created the user could only update their information by deleting an existing profile element and creating a new one. This feature is much more practical. 

# Styling 
The styling for this project is minimal. There is intentionally white space between objects and minimal use of color in order to draw the users attention to the most important elements of the App- the Add new user / Update user button. All of the other buttons are muted in comparison as they serve as secondary functions in this application. The main button also has a hover affect, darkening the blue. The form inputs also have a blue box shadow active when they are in use.
